## Using Touch Punch

Just follow these simple steps to enable touch events in your jQuery UI app:

1. Include jQuery and jQuery UI on your page.

	`<%= javascript_include_tag :jquery %>`	
	
	 `<%= javascript_include_tag :jquery-ui %>`

2. Include Touch Punch after jQuery UI and before its first use.

    Please note that if you are using jQuery UI's components, Touch Punch must be included after jquery.ui.mouse.js, as Touch Punch modifies its behavior.

   `<%= javascript_include_tag :jquery.ui.touch-punch %>`
   
3. There is no 3. Just use jQuery UI as expected and watch it work at the touch of a finger.

    `<script>$('#widget').draggable();</script>`
    
It can also be required inside another rails CoffeeScript file.

	#= require jquery.ui.touch-punch
